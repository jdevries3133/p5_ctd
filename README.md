# P5.js Starter Repo

This starter repo should feel just like Khan Academy! The difference is that the
code is running on your computer, and you just set it up with us _from scratch._
This is a lot more like how real software projects will work.

You should learn that something as simple as getting an app running on your
computer in a way that you can work on it is no simple feat! Software engineers
usually call this, "setting up your development environment." It's no different
than a master woodworker spending many decades refining the setup of their shop.
Don't feel distressed if it's hard to get your development environment perfect.
It will be hard, but if you keep putting in consistent work, your day-to-day
coding will only become easier and more enjoyable!
